# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @global-owner1 @global-owner2

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @js-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
*.js    @js-owner #This is an inline comment.

# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository. In this example,
# the stresslessnesss team in the octo-org organization owns all .txt files.
*.txt @octo-org/stresslessnesss

# In this example, @stresslessness owns any files in the build/logs
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/build/logs/ @stresslessness

# The `docs/*` pattern will match files like
# `docs/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `docs/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
docs/*  docs@example.com

# In this example, @stresslessness owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
apps/ @stresslessness

# In this example, @stresslessness owns any file in the `/docs`
# directory in the root of your repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
/docs/ @stresslessness

# In this example, any change inside the `/scripts` directory
# will require approval from @stresslessness or @stresslessness.
/scripts/ @stresslessness @OskarHulter

# In this example, @stresslessness owns any file in a `/logs` directory such as
# `/build/logs`, `/scripts/logs`, and `/deeply/nested/logs`. Any changes
# in a `/logs` directory will require approval from @stresslessness.
